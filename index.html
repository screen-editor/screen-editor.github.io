<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome to the home page for Screen Editor, <em>se</em> for short.
<em>se</em> is a screen oriented version of the classic UNIX
text editor <em>ed</em>. It&#8217;s similar to <em>vi</em> as both are modal editors with
curses interfaces. However, it differs from <em>vi</em> in that it has the same
command syntax as <em>ed</em>. For example, in <em>se</em> to escape from append mode,
you&#8217;d enter a line containing a single period instead of the <em>vi</em> way of
hitting the escape key.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>se</em> has a long <a href="http://se-editor.org/history.html">history</a>
dating back to the early 1980s. Beginning in 2013, Thomas Cort undertook
the task of modernizing the early code and build system to
get the software working on recent POSIX operating systems.
The code base was straight forward and only used facilities available 25 years
prior, and as a result, with a few modifications, it runs on
many modern operating systems. Thomas' primary motivation is to
preserve this bit of computing history. His goals are to squash any remaining
bugs and make <em>se</em> as portable as possible. No major new features will be
added. Inquiries, bug reports, patches, and other correspondance should
be directed to Thomas via e-mail at <a href="mailto:linuxgeek@gmail.com">linuxgeek@gmail.com</a></p></div>
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">Features</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
command syntax that is very familiar to users who already know <em>ed</em>.

</li>
<li>
<p>
built-in help system which describes many of the available commands.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to James Turner, there is now a package for <em>se</em> in
<a href="http://openports.se/editors/se">OpenBSD Ports</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Work on <em>se</em> is continuing. I&#8217;ve recently been using
<a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html">scan-build</a>
to identify potential bugs and fixing the code that caused
the warnings. Over the next few months I&#8217;ll be working on
documentation and bug fixes. If all goes well, another
release will be made in about 6 months. Feel free to suggest
improvements and contribute patches.</p></div>

<h3 id="_2013_03_24_version_3_0_1_released_security_fix">2013-03-24 - Version 3.0.1 Released [Security Fix]</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a security release. It is
recommended that all users upgrade. The release fixes
insecure handling of <tt>.serc</tt> files. The new behaviour is
to ignore <tt>.serc</tt> files that aren&#8217;t owned by the euid of
the se process and <tt>.serc</tt> files that are writable by
other users. No other changes are included in this
release. Thank you to Matthias Kilian of the OpenBSD
project for alerting me to this issue. A write-up about the issue
is available in security advisory

repository on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> for <em>se</em> development. The
URL is as follows: <strong>git://github.com/screen-editor/se.git</strong> The pretty web

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of <em>se</em> version 3.0.
Many thanks are owed to the original authors of this historic text editor.
There are no functional changes to <em>se</em> in this release, just autotooling
and code modernization. Download <a href="http://se-editor.org/dist/se-3.0.tar.gz">se-3.0.tar.gz</a>.</p></div>
