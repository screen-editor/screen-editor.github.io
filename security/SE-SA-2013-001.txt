se Security Advisory 2013-001

Topic: improper handling of .serc files.

Issued:		24 Mar 2013
Last Updated:	24 Mar 2013
Affected:	se before version 3.0.1

The ownership and permissions of .serc files are not checked before
executing the commands within the .serc file, even the .serc file in
the current working directory.

SUMMARY
=======

If a user could be tricked into running se in a directory where an 
attacker has placed a malicious .serc file, se will evaluate the 
commands contained within it including shell commands. This is because 
se unconditionally executes the .serc file in the current working 
directory even if it is owned or writable by another user.

IMPACT
======

A user could be duped into running arbitrary shell commands.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of se prior to 3.0.1

FIXES
=====

The se project suggests all users upgrade to se version 3.0.1 or later.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

This issue was identified by Matthias Kilian of the OpenBSD project.
